				Thanks for taking interest in using my plugins!<br>
				Here are the terms one should follow while using them:

			<hr>
			<h3>Terms of Use for plugins:</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>These plugins may be used in both free and commercial games.</li>
				<li><code>Maybee Rezbit (SomeRanDev)</code> or <code>Maybee "SomeRanDev" Rezbit</code> must be given credit and <a href="http://someran.dev/rpgmaker" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this website</a> must also be linked.</li>
				<li><span class="green"> You are allowed to edit and reuse the code directly as long as itâ€™s for your own project, extension plugins, or built-in compatibility patches.</span></li>
				<li><span class="green">You are free to package, encrypt, compile, etc. as long as itâ€™s being done to the project or code-base as a whole. However, while in their normal JavaScript form, please refrain from changing the filename and comment headers of the plugins.</span></li>
				<li><span class="red">Please do not redistribute the plugins outside of game releases.</span></li>
				<li><span class="red">Please refrain from taking code unless itâ€™s for project that requires the plugin in question.</span></li>
				<li><span class="blue">If you wish to redistribute edits, please create an extension plugin. If a certain aspect of a Plugin cannot be modified without changing the original, contact me and I will fix the issue and/or give permission to redistribute the original.</span></li>
				<li><span class="blue">If I see your game uses one of my Plugins and I shamelessly ask for a free copy, please do not judge me too much ðŸ˜€ (Though, honestly, if itâ€™s actually a really good game, Iâ€™d probably just purchase it myself to support the good cause.)</span></li>
				<li><span class="purple">You are free to port plugins from previous versions of RPG Maker to the one you are using as long as itâ€™s exclusively for your own projects, projects of the client, etcâ€¦</span></li>
			</ul>

			<hr>

			<h3>Important Notes:</h3>
			<p>The Terms of Use are subject to change at any time. Games and projects are expected to follow the Terms of Use that were listed at the time of the game/projectâ€™s current versionâ€™s release.</p>
			<p>Yup, thatâ€™s pretty much it.<br>
			Until next time! ~</p>
