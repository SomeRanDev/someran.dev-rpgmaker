# [SomeRanDev's RPG Maker Website](https://someran.dev/rpgmaker)

My remake of my RPG Maker plugin website. It's used for the distribution of my RPG Maker plugins.

You can visit it at https://someran.dev/rpgmaker.

## RPG Maker Plugins Repo

My plugins are now hosted on their own Github repository found [here](https://github.com/SomeRanDev/RPGMakerPlugins). Bug reports and pull requests can be made there. Any changes to plugins there will be automatically applied upon rebuilding the site.

## Old RPG Maker Website

An archive of my original RPG Maker website is available [here](https://somerandev.github.io/sumrndm.site-archive) (and as a Github repository [here](https://github.com/SomeRanDev/sumrndm.site-archive)).

## Github Pages

This site is hosted using the Github Pages on the main repository: [https://github.com/SomeRanDev/someran.dev](https://github.com/SomeRanDev/someran.dev).

This repo's Pages is used for hosting the current https://sumrndm.site and its redirection HTML files that automatically move users from a link on the old site to its correlating link on https://somran.dev/plugins. The implementation for generating these files is simple and handled by `tools/GenerateRedirects.ts`.
